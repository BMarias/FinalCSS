    <h1>Brian's Decisions</h1>
    <section class = "intro">
      <p> Some people discover their favorite shows and movies through deep self-reflection, artistic analysis, or years of careful media study.</p>

      <p> No scientific research has been done to provide these results.</p>
      <p>I, on the other hand, simply stumbled into them like a raccoon finding treasure in a recycling bin.</p>
      <p>It all began in middle school, when I first encountered anime—not through some elegant Studio Ghibli masterpiece like most people—but through a chaotic chain of YouTube AMVs set to Linkin Park. I didn’t understand half of what I saw, but there were giant robots, 
         glowing eyes, and someone yelling “Lelouch vi Britannia commands you!” and suddenly my brain said, “Yes. This. This is peak storytelling.” 
         Eventually, I watched Code Geass properly, and it felt like someone took chess, politics, Death Note-level mind games, giant mechs, plot twists, and blended it into the most unhinged emotional rollercoaster imaginable. There’s betrayal, rebellion, 
         questionable decisions, zero-gravity pizza parties—everything required to shape a person’s taste in fiction forever. I finished it staring at my wall like I had just seen the face of God… and He was wearing a Zero mask.
      </p>
      <p>Years later, my cinematic soulmate arrived: Dune: Part Two.
          A movie so dramatic that even the sand has character development.
          I walked into the theater expecting a sci-fi movie about sand and spicy space politics. I walked out feeling like I had witnessed a prophecy, experienced a spiritual awakening, and now belonged to a desert warrior tribe. 
          The visuals, the soundtrack, the worms the size of apartment complexes—perfection. Hans Zimmer basically slapped my soul with a soundwave and I thanked him.
          Between Code Geass and Dune: Part Two, I realized I apparently love stories where a brilliant, morally-gray protagonist gains way too much power, challenges empires, rides something dramatic (mechs… worms… same energy), 
          and leaves me questioning my life choices by the ending.
      </p>
      <p>So yes—after years of watching more anime and movies than I’d like to admit, I can confidently say that Lelouch Lamperouge and Paul Atreides have permanently burned themselves into my “Favorite Characters I Should Not Be Rooting For” list. 
        And honestly? I wouldn’t have it any other way.
